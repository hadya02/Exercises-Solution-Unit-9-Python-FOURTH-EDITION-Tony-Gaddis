File Encryption and Decryption
Write a program that uses a dictionary to assign “codes” to each letter of the alphabet. For
example:
codes = { ‘A’ : ‘%’, ‘a’ : ‘9’, ‘B’ : ‘@’, ‘b’ : ‘#’, etc . . .}
Using this example, the letter A would be assigned the symbol %, the letter a would be
assigned the number 9, the letter B would be assigned the symbol @, and so forth.
The program should open a specified text file, read its contents, then use the dictionary
to write an encrypted version of the file’s contents to a second file. Each character in the
second file should contain the code for the corresponding character in the first file.
Write a second program that opens an encrypted file and displays its decrypted contents
on the screen.

import ex3 as kabul_file
coded=kabul_file.coded
encrypted_file=open("encrypted.txt","r")
encrypted_contents=encrypted_file.read()
encrypted_value,encrypted_keys=[],[]
code_values,code_keys=coded.values(),coded.keys()
for v in code_values:
    encrypted_value.append(v)
for k in code_keys:
    encrypted_keys.append(k)
decrypted=""
foe each in encrypted_contents: 
    for values in encrypted_values:
        if each==values:
            if each!=".":
                decrypted+=(encrypted_keys[encrypted_values.index (values)])
            else:
                decrypted+=".\n"
print(decrypted)
