Capital Quiz
Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program
should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user
to enter that state’s capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and
incorrect responses. (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of
countries and their capitals.)


def main():
    countries_capitals={"Afghanistan":"Kabul","Iran":"Tehran","Frence":"Paris","Pakistan":"Islamabad","Germany":"Berlin","Spain":"Madrid","Turkey":"Ankara","India":"New Delhi","England":"London","Sudi Aribia":"Riadh"}
    true_ans=0
    for country in countries_capitals:
        answer=input("what is the name of "+conuntry+"'s capital:").lower()
        if answer ==countries_capitals[countery]:
            true_ans+=1
    print("Your correct answers :",true_ans)
    print("your incorrect answers :",len(countries_capitals)-true_ans)
